Example code from: https://github.com/Raruto/leaflet-kmz
Raruto's example/code left a lot to be desired in terms of use, setup, externally loading maps...

This repo is for simplifying it and added the "latest" 2017 map (as of 2024, their August 2023 "Very High Resolution" hasn't been released yet) of the Koppen climate classification map.
